What I do, what I like, what consumes most of my time etc.

### Student
I am a final year student at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology with a major in Computer Engineering and a minor in cyber security. I am also a research intern at IIT Delhi, working with Dr VVK Srinivas. I am also working as an open-source contributor at PyMC.

### Other Interests
I was lucky enough to travel a lot of places in India (mostly) and got to click a lot of random things around me. A collection of them is present at my vsco

Apart from this, I pursued football in high school in my first year of college. Growing up in India with no prominent footballers was tough; I greatly respect Sunil Chhetri (Captain of the Indian National Team) for his contributions to football in India. I belive Thomas MÃ¼ller might be the most underrated footballer in Europe, his contributions for both national team and Bayern Munich were largely overlooked by people. 

I listen to a lot of music while working, mostly hip hop and admire works by Kanye West, Lil Uzi Vert, Baby Keem and Playboi Carti.

I spend most of my time watching documentaries (and sitcoms lately) or reading stuff on Reddit. I find reading fiction tedious and tiring, so I only stick with reading books/articles that aren't fictitious.
